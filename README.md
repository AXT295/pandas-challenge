# pandas-challenge

In this module you are the new head of data science at your school district. You will assist the Board of Education and the Mayor in making strategic decisions on future school budgets and priorities in this capacity. To create a report with the following information, you need to use Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. A written description, which is bases on the data, of at least two observed trends that should be included in the report.

District Summary
You must perform the required calculations and then use a DataFrame to build a high level snapshot of district's key metrics.

Include the following:

Total number of unique schools

Total students

Total budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary
To create a DataFrame that summarizes the important metrics of each school, you will need to perform the necessary calculations.

Include the following:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

Save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

Math Scores by Grade
Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Reading Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

After working on this module I had the help of reaching out to my classmates on slack and setting up zoom calls. We did still struggle with trying to find a solution with some of the dataframes. Also had assistance AskBCS on slack who were a help when pushing my files to github.
